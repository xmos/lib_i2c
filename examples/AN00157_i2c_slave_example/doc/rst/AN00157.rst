Overview
--------

Introduction
............

The XMOS |I2C| library provides software defined, industry-standard,
|I2C| components that allow you to create devices which can be either |I2C|
bus masters or slaves using xCORE GPIO ports.

|I2C| is a two-wire bus with defined protocols for connecting devices. There
is a clock and a data line, both of which are pulled high by external pull-up resistors and driven low by the |I2C| devices.

The XMOS |I2C| library includes support for master and slave devices at speeds of
up to 400kb/s.

This application note demonstrates how to create an |I2C| slave device
using the XMOS |I2C| library. It creates an example register file which can be
read and written by both |I2C| masters and a user application on the xCORE.

The application note includes an |I2C| master which accesses the register file by
looping back the clock and data lines between the master and slave. This is done
in simulation using a loopback with pull-up enabled.

   Application block diagram

The application uses three logical cores:

   * The first core implements an |I2C| master and a test application performing
     register reads and writes.
   * The second core is used by the |I2C| slave.
   * The third core is used by an example host application which uses the
     register file.

The register file is distributed between the two logical cores using it.

How to use |I2C| slave
----------------------

The Makefile
............

To start using the |I2C|, you need to add ``lib_i2c`` to you Makefile::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_i2c ...

This demo also uses the logging library (``lib_logging``) for the ``debug_printf``
function. This is a faster, but restricted version of the C-Standard Library
``printf`` function. So the Makefile also includes::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_logging ..

The logging library is configurable at compile-time allowing calls to
``debug_printf()`` to be easily enabled or disabled. For the prints to
be enabled it is necessary to add the following to the compile flags::

  XCC_FLAGS = .. -DDEBUG_PRINT_ENABLE=1 ..

Includes
........

This application requires a few system headers. XMOS xCORE specific
defines for declaring and initialising hardware are defined in ``xs1.h`` and
the ``_exit()`` function which allows the application to terminate once the
demo is complete is provided by ``syscall.h``.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: include <xs1.h>
   :end-on: include <syscall.h>

The |I2C| library functions are defined in ``i2c.h``. This header must
be included in your code to use the library. The logging functions are
provided by ``debug_print.h``.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: include "i2c.h"
   :end-on: include "debug_print.h"

Allocating hardware resources
.............................

An |I2C| interface requires both a clock and data pin. In this application note
there is a slave and a master and each require both a clock and data pin.
On an xCORE the pins are controlled by ``ports``. The application therefore
declares four 1-bit ports:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: port p_slave_scl
   :end-on: port p_master_sda

|newpage|

The register file interfaces
............................

The register file will interact with both the |I2C| slave and the user application.
The interface to the |I2C| slave is defined ``i2c.h``. The interface
to the user application is a custom interface which is declared in the application:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: typedef interface register_if
   :end-on: } register_if;

This interface declares four functions, three of which the user application can use
to acces the register file and one which allows the register file to notify
the user application that something has changed. The ``notification`` call means
that the user application does not have to waste cycles polling the register file
to determine if a register value has changed.

The register file implementation
................................

The register file has a fixed number of registers that are assumed to start at
address 0. The number of registers is controlled by the define::

  #define NUM_REGISTERS 10

The register file implementation fuction is declared as:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: [[distributable]]
   :end-on: server register_if app

The xC keyword ``distributable`` means that this function does not need to consume
a whole logical core itself, but the functions it defines can be called in-line
on other logical cores that are using its interface functions.

The register file is declared with the ``i2c`` and ``app`` interfaces described
above. In both cases the interfaces are declared as ``server`` so the register
file will respond to the function calls but not initiate any. The only exception is the ``notification`` call where the register file informs the user application that a register has changed.

|newpage|

The register file then declares storage for the registers:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: uint8_t registers[NUM_REGISTERS]
   :end-before: // This variable

The interface to the |I2C| slave needs some local state to track which
register is being accessed. An |I2C| master will first perform a write
operation with the register number being used and then either write data to
that register or read from that register. The ``current_regnum`` variable
is used to record which register is being read/written.

The ``changed_regnum`` is used by the interface to the user application to record
which register was last modified:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: int current_regnum
   :end-on: int changed_regnum

And the rest of the register file is a ``while(1) { select`` loop. All
``distributable`` functions must be of this form, with declarations followed
by a ``while(1) { select`` loop.

Within the loop the register file handles the functions provided by both
interfaces. First the interface to the user application:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: case app.set_register
   :end-before: // Handle I2C slave

The interface to the application is very straight-forward, with each function
validating that the ``regnum`` specified is valid and then performing the
requested operation.

It is worth noting the syntax of the ``app.get_register`` function which is of the form::

  case app.get_register(int regnum) -> uint8_t data:

The ``->`` operator indicates the result of the ``get_register`` function is
returned in the ``data`` variable. The assignment to the ``data`` variable is
the data that will be returned.

The |I2C| slave callback interface declares nine functions that the register
file must implement. Of those functions, only five are actually used by the
register file, but the others would be used by other |I2C| slave devices.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: case i2c.ack_read_request
   :end-before: case i2c.start_write_request

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: case i2c.ack_write_request
   :end-before: case i2c.start_master_write

The register file implements the ``ack_read_request()`` and ``ack_write_request()``
functions to control whether an ACK or NACK is signaled on the bus for each start
of read or write request. All writes are accepted, and reads are only accepted
if the register number has been selected first.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: case i2c.master_sent_data
   :end-before: case i2c.start_master_read

The ``master_sent_data()`` interface function is called for each byte received
by the |I2C| slave. The first byte is assumed to be a register number.
Subsequent bytes received before the ``stop_bit()`` function is called are
assumed to be data to write to the specified register.

If a register is written then the ``master_sent_data()`` function also informs
the user application if by calling the ``app.register_changed()`` notification
function after having stored which register was modified in the
``changed_regnum`` variable.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: case i2c.master_requires_data
   :end-before: case i2c.stop_bit

The ``master_requires_data()`` interface function is called whenever the |I2C|
slave is required to send a byte to the master. If a register number has been
selected first it will read that register, otherwise it returns 0.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: case i2c.stop_bit
   :end-before: // select

Finally, the ``stop_bit()`` function is called to indicate that the |I2C|
transaction is finished. The register file clears the ``current_regnum``
variable to ensure it has to be set for the next transaction.

Slave application
.................

The slave application gives an example of how the register file could be used.
It is passed a ``client`` interface to the register file so that it can access
the registers. It then sits in a ``while(1)`` loop inverting the data
that is written to the register file and printing when it does this:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: void slave_application
   :end-before: void master_application

Master application
..................

The master application is providing stimulus to test the slave register file
and application:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: void master_application
   :end-before: {

It is passed the interface to the |I2C| master and the device address of the
slave that it is testing. It then performs a single register write and checks
that it completes successfully:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: i2c.write_reg
   :end-before: // Read a single

Then it reads the register value back and ensures the read completed correctly
and that the data has been inverted:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: i2c.read_reg
   :end-before: // Test finished

The application main() function
...............................

The ``main()`` function sets up the tasks in the application.

Firstly, the ``interfaces`` are declared. In xC interfaces provide a
means of concurrent tasks communicating with each other. In this
application there is an interface to the |I2C| slave, an interface between the
application and the register file, and an interface to the |I2C| master.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: i2c_slave_callback_if i_i2c;
   :end-on: i2c_master_if i2c[1];

The address of the |I2C| slave is declared:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: uint8_t device_addr = 0x3c
   :end-before: par

The rest of the ``main()`` function starts all the tasks in parallel
using the xC ``par`` construct:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: par
   :end-before: return 0

This code starts the |I2C| slave, register file, slave application, |I2C| master,
and master application. Because the register file is marked as ``distributable``
it will not actually use a logical core but will be run on the logical cores with
the |I2C| slave and register file. Likewise, the |I2C| master is marked as
``distributable`` and will share the logical core with the master application. So
the entire system only requires three logical cores.

On the ``Simulator`` tab, ``Loopback`` section, select ``Enable pin connections``.
Then under the ``Pin Connetions`` click ``Add`` and create a loopback from
``tile[0]``, ``XS1_PORT_1E`` to ``tile[0]``, ``XS1_PORT_1G`` and enable ``pullup``.
Again, under the ``Pin Connetions`` click ``Add`` and create a loopback from
``tile[0]``, ``XS1_PORT_1F`` to ``tile[0]``, ``XS1_PORT_1H`` and enable ``pullup``.

.. figure:: images/loopback.*
   :width: 80%

   Loopback

Click ``Apply`` and then click ``Run``. The application will run and generate
the following output::

  REGFILE: select reg[3]
  REGFILE: reg[3] <- 12
  SLAVE: Change register 3 value from 12 to ED
  REGFILE: stop_bit
  REGFILE: select reg[3]
  REGFILE: reg[3] -> ED
  REGFILE: stop_bit
  MASTER: Read from addr 0x3C, 0x3 SUCCESS (got 0xED, expected 0xED)

|newpage|

When it finishes, it will switch to the VCD trace viewer and open the signal file
created. Hide the console by clicking on the console button on the right-hand side
of the window:

.. figure:: images/hide_console.*

   Hide console

An existing waveform setup can be loaded using the ``Read Session File`` button
from the ``Waves`` window:

.. figure:: images/read_session_file.*
   :width: 8%

   Read session file

and open the ``xvcd.xml`` file. This configures the waves to show the clock and
data waves and the direction of the ports.

On the command-line
...................

On the command-line run change to the application note folder and run::

  xmake

Then run ``xsim`` with the following arguments::

  xsim --trace-to trace.txt --plugin LoopbackPort.so
    "-pullup -port tile[0] XS1_PORT_1E 1 0 -port tile[0] XS1_PORT_1G 1 0
     -pullup -port tile[0] XS1_PORT_1F 1 0 -port tile[0] XS1_PORT_1H 1 0"
     bin/AN00157_i2c_slave_example.xe

If you would like to look at the waveforms to further understand how the |I2C|
is working then add the following to the xsim command arguments before the name
of the binary::

  --vcd-tracing "-o trace.vcd -tile tile[0] -ports"

The VCD file can be opened in xTIMEcomposer or any other VCD viewer.
